# Final Project Design

Your final project should consist of a detailed design for a data-driven project, which takes into consideration questions about context, relationship and positionality that we have been discussing in this course. Your data source must be locally situated to at least one team member's local context or social position.

***This document will be updated week by week as the course progresses, but for now, it should give you a good idea of what will be required as you develop your initial ideas.***

**For Tuesday, February 16:** You and your partner will deliver an initial proposal for your project (approximately 300-500 words in length). You must address the following questions:
- What is the project?
- Where is the data coming from?
- What is the reasoning for using the data you are using, in the way you are using it?
- What are the specific ethical considerations for this project?

These proposals will be submitted in [the Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1lyy198Frc8NpME4o39WbpE13pHUuELz9?usp=sharing).

**For Tuesday, February 23:** You and your partner will deliver a sample of the data source you are planning on using. ***Do not “clean” or alter this data in any way.***

This data source does not have to be extensive or encompass the full scope of your project design, but it does have to give us some sense of the categories and values you will be using as the foundation of the project.

You will submit this sample to [the Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Olc9mmGDtbLhJtMejKt1S2tGVIdb1OnV?usp=sharing), as well as work with it in class, so please make sure that all members of the team are equipped with a copy.

**For Tuesday, March 2:** You and your partner will make some initial explorations of the data using JavaScript.

**For Tuesday, March 16:** Your final project design is due. This must be submitted as a single document, containing the following sections:

##### I. INTRODUCTION

What is the project you are proposing? What data does it work with, and what is the goal of the analysis?

##### II. CONTEXT

This is the meat of the project design, and what I will be spending the most time reading. Here you will establish the context for the project, including the context in which the data was collected, and in which you are approaching the work. Each member of the team is required to discuss their own relationship to the project and data collection, and discuss the ways in which this informs the final design for the project.

##### III. PROOF OF CONCEPT

Documentation of your project in some prototype form. This does not have to be extensive or elaborate, but it *does* have to show the essential principles and aims of your project as functioning, and point to the potential for a more realized form.

##### IV. PROCESS

This section will detail the process by which you and your partner arrived at the specifics of this design. Here I am interested in trial and error—the things you attempted but failed, and the things you didn't think would work but did. I also would like to see your decision making process outlined—why are you making the choices you are making? What other possibilities are there, and why did you determine that they won't work?

##### V. CONCLUSION & NEXT STEPS

What have you found in these first steps you have taken? What are your immediate next steps? What, if any, changes will you be making to the project design based on what you have found from your initial explorations?

This document will be submitted to the Google Drive folder. In addition, each team will prepare a short presentation on their project design for the final day of class. I will provide more details about presentation requirements as the final week draws closer.
