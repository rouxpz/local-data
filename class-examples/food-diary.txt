Today I ate pasta with tomato sauce, cream and Parmesan cheese. I had seltzer to drink. I felt really sleepy afterwards and I ended up napping for two hours, so I didn't get as much work done for the day as I'd planned.

Today I made stir fry with bell peppers, zucchini, onions and carrots. I ate it with brown rice. I had lemonade to drink. I felt a little more active today than yesterday, but still pretty tired.

Today I didn't feel so well, so I just had noodle soup and tea. I didn't really have much of an appetite and only ate because I knew I had to eat something for the day.
