# Analog Data Collection Exercise

For this assignment, I would like you to create a small dataset from something in your own environment. The only rule is that **you cannot use computational processes *of any kind* to generate the data**; you must manually collect it and make decisions about what to include and what not to include.

Some examples could be people riding bicycles vs. cars you see on your street in an hour; the number of times you procrastinated on doing work during the week, and what you did instead; or how often and in what contexts you hear a particular government figure's name on the news over the course of one day (just to give you some ideas, but feel free to do anything you want for this). Visual documentation for this assignment can include (but not limited to) photographs, journal entries or drawings.

Your assignment consists of three key components:

- Visual documentation of the dataset in some form  
- A written summary of your dataset (approximately 1-2 paragraphs) explaining what it contains and what it does not, how many items are in the dataset, and what you expect it to tell us
- A brief reflection on the process (approximately 2-3 paragraphs), outlining your reasoning for creating the dataset you did, how you decided what to collect and what not to collect, and your expectations of what you would end up with versus reality.

Submit your assignment by uploading it to the class Google Drive folder, inside a folder labeled with your name.
