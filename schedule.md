# Local Data

## Schedule

All readings can be found in the [class Google Drive folder](https://tktktk.com). If you have trouble accessing any of the readings each week, please let me know ASAP.

### Week 1: Conceptions
We will introduce ourselves, our backgrounds, our positions in the world, and our interests in data and the course. We will also begin to discuss the ways in which we conceive of data, and its purpose in the work that we do.

<u>**Reading Due:**</u>  
- Gitelman, L. & Jackson, V. (2013). Introduction. In *“Raw Data” is an Oxymoron* (ed. Gitelman, L.), pp. 1-14. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.

### Week 2: Context
We will begin to talk about “big” and “small” data, and discuss students’ explorations of “small” data in their own local environments. Students will also receive their partner assignments for the term, and we will break out into small groups to begin discussing common interests and potential data sources and projects specific to their local contexts.

**ASSIGNMENT DUE:** Analog data collection exercise

<u>**Reading Due:**</u>
- boyd, d. & Crawford, K. (2012). Critical Questions for Big Data: Provocations for a cultural, technological, and scholarly phenomenon. *Information, Communication & Society*, 15(5), 662-679.

- Loukissas, Y. (2019). All data are local: Thinking critically in a data-driven society. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press. (1 chapter)

### Week 3: Care
This week we will discuss ethics surrounding data collection, including what data it is appropriate to collect for a project, how to share results or outputs, and whether it is appropriate to collect data at all in certain instances. Students will also present their final project proposals for feedback.

### Week 4: Collection
This class will cover the decisions made when setting up a data collection project, including those regarding what to collect and why. We will also discuss the motivations behind the impulse to collect all data possible, regardless of whether or not we can immediately see uses for it. Students will bring in a sample data source for their project, and we will go over processes of formatting it in JSON for use in web-based visualizations.

### Week 5: Clarity
We will discuss processes of classification, categorization and analysis, and examine the specific human assumptions that go into making data “legible” for an audience. Students will also take the sample data sources they have collected for their projects and experiment with different ways of classifying and sorting them, and discuss what each approach adds and leaves out.

### Week 6: Consequences
This week we will discuss the implications of data collection, and holistically look at the themes we have been discussing during the course. We will think about the difference between intent and impact in creative projects utilizing data, and discuss ways to be more careful and critical in our appraisal of our own work.

### Week 7: Conclusion
Final project design presentations!
